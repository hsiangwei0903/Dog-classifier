This is the UW Capstone Project funded by [Wyze Labs](https://www.wyze.com/) and the [UW ECE department](https://www.ece.uw.edu/).
This branch contains programming work done by Trinh Nguyen in Q1 and Q2.

## Q1 Folder
This folder contains code used for benchmarking and evaluating ResNet50 and MobileNetV2. Download each Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) and run the code cells to reproduce the results.

## ClassFineTuningExperiment.ipynb
This file contains the experiment done in Q2. Download the Jupyter Notebook to perform the experiment. There are directions in the file tto help reproduce the results.

## PythonScripts.ipynb
This file contains scripts (video-to-images, file renaming, google images scraper) used for data processing. Download the Jupyter Notebook to use the scripts. Code and example usages are within the file.
